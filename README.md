# My own .vimrc

By default, `.vimrc`should be located in `~` folder

## Plugin installation

1. Without further ado, [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), is required in order to load all plugins.
2. Launch vim.
3. Enter command mode by pressing `:` while in normal mode.
4. Use one of the following commands according to your needs.
```vim
" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate
" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal
```
:warning: Some plugins may require some extra steps to be installed like for exemple [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).
